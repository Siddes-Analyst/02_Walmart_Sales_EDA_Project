# 🛒 Walmart Sales Data - EDA Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores Walmart sales data to uncover insights, trends, and performance metrics using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The focus areas include:
- Monthly sales trends
- Top-performing products and customers
- Region-wise sales performance
- Profit vs Sales analysis

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `01_Dataset & Case_Study/`: Contains raw CSV & Excel format datasets and EDA-Case Study
- `02_Notebook/`: Jupyter Notebook with all the EDA code and visualizations
- `03_Documentation/`: Summary of project for README or report
- `04_Images/`: Plotted Chart images

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Excel (for final reporting)
- Jupyter Notebook (code)

## 📈 Key Insights
- Region `North` had the highest sales but lowest profit margin
- Top 5 products contributed to `40%` of total revenue
- `2024` had more consistent month-over-month growth
- Repeated customer made `9%` of sales and `10.5%` of profit
- Region & Category has `negative correlation` between quantity sold and profit per unit
